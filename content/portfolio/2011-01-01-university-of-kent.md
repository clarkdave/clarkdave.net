During my time at the University of Kent's web team I developed a content management engine designed ease the publication and maintenance of hundreds of disparate websites. This has been in successful deployment for over three years and continues to power thousands of pages across dozens of departments, and allows central brand changes to be rolled out quickly.

The system was well received by attendees when it was presented at IWMW 2011 (an academic technology conference), and continues to be in active development.
