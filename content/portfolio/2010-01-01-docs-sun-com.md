While working at Sun Microsystems I was tasked with the on-going development of docs.sun.com, a vast application platform which delivered the majority of Sun's documentation for its products to thousands of customers and technicians. This involved a hefty amount of XML and XSLT, combined with plenty of Java and shell scripting to keep things running smoothly.

As part of the transition of Sun's online presence to Oracle's, I prototyped options for the migration path and wrote utilities to extract 100,000s of books, articles and assets. These would eventually aid in the migration to Oracle's Technology Network and allow docs.sun.com to finally be shutdown.
