	%h2 About me
	%p
		I'm Dave Clark, a British software developer and technical co-founder at <a href='http://prizgo.com'>Prizgo</a>, a <a href='http://www.startupbootcamp.org'>Startupbootcamp Berlin</a> alumnus. In the past I've worked at Sun Microsystems and <a href='http://oracle.com'>Oracle</a> in the web engineering team, and was the lead web developer at the University of Kent's web team. I also like to keep busy with side-projects, which are mostly documented <a href='/work'>elsewhere on my site</a>.

		I use a lot of Ruby and Javascript at the moment, but also have extensive experience with Java and PHP. I have dabbled with Python, Occam-pi and Haskell and generally enjoy exploring new technologies and platforms.

The source is <a href='https://github.com/clarkdave/clarkdave.net'> on GitHub</a> and I've written a supporting article on <a href='/2012/02/building-a-static-blog-with-nanoc/'>building a static blog with nanoc</a>.
