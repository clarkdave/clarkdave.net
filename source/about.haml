      I'm Dave Clark, a software developer and technical co-founder at <a href='http://loyaltylion.com'>LoyaltyLion</a>, a <a href='http://www.startupbootcamp.org'>Startupbootcamp Berlin</a> alumnus. In the past I've worked at Sun Microsystems and <a href='http://oracle.com'>Oracle</a> in the web engineering team, and was the lead web developer at the University of Kent's web team.

      I use a lot of Ruby and Javascript at the moment, but also have extensive experience with Java and PHP.

      This site is built using <a href='https://middlemanapp.com/'>Middleman</a>, which is a nice little static site generator. I used to use <a href='http://nanoc.stoneship.org'>nanoc</a>, another static site generator, but I because I primarily use this site as a blog, Middleman has nicer tooling for that  purpose. The source for this site is <a href='https://github.com/clarkdave/clarkdave.net'> on GitHub</a>.
